# Hill-Bagger-API
Express app

This is the backend for the Hill-Bagging-Web application. It expands on the previous version to include all hills in the database. 

It provides all the hills in The Database of British and Irish Hills (DoBIH) and allows for filtering by name, number, location or classification. 
As well as ordering the data by name, number, height, location.

The Express app uses Prisma and Jest and the data is stored in a MongoDB database.
